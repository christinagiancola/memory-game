### Memory Game
#### Built using vanilla JavaScript.
##### This is a version of the classic memory matching card game with a Parks and Rec theme. 
##### I started this game while completing freeCodeCamp's "Learn JavaScript by Building 7 Games" and then built upon it with additonal styling, responsiveness, and bug fixes. 
##### As one of my earlier coding projects, I gained experience with: 
##### - JavaScript
##### - DOM Manipulation
##### - Version Control (GIT) 
##### - HTML5
##### - CSS3
##### - Flexbox
##### - Responsive Web Design
